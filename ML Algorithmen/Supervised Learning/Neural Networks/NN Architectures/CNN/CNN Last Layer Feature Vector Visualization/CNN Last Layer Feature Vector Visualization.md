We can pass a bunch of images into the trained net and then compare resulting feature vectors. We can for example check by [[k nearest neighbor]] which images are close to each other according to the feature vector.

To be able to plot the feature vector, we need to reduce the dimensions of it from xD to 2D. We could to that by [[PCA]] or [[t-SNE]]
