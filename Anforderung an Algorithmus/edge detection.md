Famous and well-working edge detection pipeline:
[[Canny Edge Detection]]

[[Fourier Transformation]] can be used to get an overview over the [[high low frequency]] in the image

High frequency areas represent edges and we can filter edges in general by applying [[high pass filters]]

If we want to filter only vertical or horizont edges, we can use [[Sobel Filters]]

When you apply [[Convolution]] for edge detection, you have to think about how to do [[edge handling]]
