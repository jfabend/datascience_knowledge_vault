matching function to find similiar arrangements of two keypoints in the query image and in the training image.

These works on the basis of metrics like the euklidian distance or the similarity of the order of zeros and ones in the feature vectors.
One example is the [[Hamming metric]]

```python
cv2.BFMatcher(normType = cv2.NORM_L2, crossCheck = false)
```

The parameters for BFMatcher are explained here: [[normType]] & [[crossCheck]]

```python
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set the default figure size
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [14.0, 7.0]

# Load the training image
image1 = cv2.imread('./images/face.jpeg')

# Load the query image
image2 = cv2.imread('./images/face.jpeg')

# Convert the training image to RGB
training_image = cv2.cvtColor(image1, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Convert the query image to RGB
query_image = cv2.cvtColor(image2, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Display the training and query images
plt.subplot(121)
plt.title('Training Image')
plt.imshow(training_image)
plt.subplot(122)
plt.title('Query Image')
plt.imshow(query_image)
plt.show()

# Convert the training image to gray scale
training_gray = cv2.cvtColor(training_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Convert the query image to gray scale
query_gray = cv2.cvtColor(query_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Set the parameters of the ORB algorithm by specifying the maximum number of keypoints to locate and
# the pyramid decimation ratio
orb = cv2.ORB_create(1000, 2.0)

# Find the keypoints in the gray scale training and query images and compute their ORB descriptor.
# The None parameter is needed to indicate that we are not using a mask in either case.
keypoints_train, descriptors_train = orb.detectAndCompute(training_gray, None)
keypoints_query, descriptors_query = orb.detectAndCompute(query_gray, None)

# Create a Brute Force Matcher object. Set crossCheck to True so that the BFMatcher will only return consistent
# pairs. Such technique usually produces best results with minimal number of outliers when there are enough matches.
bf = cv2.BFMatcher(cv2.NORM_HAMMING, crossCheck = True)

# Perform the matching between the ORB descriptors of the training image and the query image
matches = bf.match(descriptors_train, descriptors_query)

# The matches with shorter distance are the ones we want. So, we sort the matches according to distance
matches = sorted(matches, key = lambda x : x.distance)

# Connect the keypoints in the training image with their best matching keypoints in the query image.
# The best matches correspond to the first elements in the sorted matches list, since they are the ones
# with the shorter distance. We draw the first 300 mathces and use flags = 2 to plot the matching keypoints
# without size or orientation.
result = cv2.drawMatches(training_gray, keypoints_train, query_gray, keypoints_query, matches[:300], query_gray, flags = 2)

# Display the best matching points
plt.title('Best Matching Points')
plt.imshow(result)
plt.show()

# Print the number of keypoints detected in the training image
print("Number of Keypoints Detected In The Training Image: ", len(keypoints_train))

# Print the number of keypoints detected in the query image
print("Number of Keypoints Detected In The Query Image: ", len(keypoints_query))

# Print total number of matching points between the training and query images
print("\nNumber of Matching Keypoints Between The Training and Query Images: ", len(matches))
```
