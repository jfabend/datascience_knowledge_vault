identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data

Unsupervised Anomaly Detection:
[[(Density-Based) DBSCAN]]
[[k nearest neighbor]]
[[local outlier factory]]

Supervised Anomaly Detection:
We train a model (a classifier like [[SVM]]) to detect outliers
Attention: We always have an imbalanced data set here
