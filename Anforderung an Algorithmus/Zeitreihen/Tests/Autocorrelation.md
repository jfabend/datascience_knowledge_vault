Above is an example of an autocorrelation plot. Looking closely, you realize that the first value and the 24th value have a high autocorrelation. Similarly, the 12th and 36th observations are highly correlated. This means that we will find a very similar value at every 24 unit of time

**autocorrelation** is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them

Since autocorrelation refers to repeating patterns within the time series, it is linked to [[Seasonality]]
