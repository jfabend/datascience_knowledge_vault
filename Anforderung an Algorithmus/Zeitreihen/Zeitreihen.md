Methods to model a time series in order to make predictions

What can we model with time series algorithms?
- Level / mean
- Trend
- Seasonality

There are methods for [[univariate Zeitreihen]] und [[multivariate Zeitreihen]]

Further methods:
[[HWES]]
[[LSTM]]
[[Gated Recurrent Unit GRU]]
[[Convolutional NN]]
- [[WaveNet]]
[[ResNet - Residual Network]]

Tests:
[[Stationarit√§t]]
Ideally, we want to have a stationary time series for modelling. Of course, not all of them are stationary, but we can make different transformations to make them stationary.

[[Autocorrelation]]
[[Seasonality]]

Python Packages:
[[tsfresh]]
[[tslearn]]
[[darts]]
