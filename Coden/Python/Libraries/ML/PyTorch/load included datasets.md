```python
# our basic libraries
import torch
import torchvision

# data loading and transforming
from torchvision.datasets import FashionMNIST
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import transforms

# The output of torchvision datasets are PILImage images of range [0, 1]. 
# We transform them to Tensors for input into a CNN

## Define a transform to read the data in as a tensor
data_transform = transforms.ToTensor()

# choose the training and test datasets
train_data = FashionMNIST(root='./data', train=True,
                                   download=False, transform=data_transform)

# Print out some stats about the training data
print('Train data, number of images: ', len(train_data))
