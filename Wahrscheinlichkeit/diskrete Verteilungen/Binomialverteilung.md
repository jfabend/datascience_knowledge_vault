The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution for obtaining exactly **_k_** successes out of **_n_** _Bernoulli trails_.

Characteristics of _Bernoulli trails_ -

-   Each trail has only two possible outcomes â€” success and failure.
-   The total number of trails is fixed.
-   The probability of success and failure remains the same throughout all the trails.
-   The trails are independent of each other.

The binomial distribution is a way of calculating the probability of **_k_** successes from **_n_** _Bernoulli trails_.
