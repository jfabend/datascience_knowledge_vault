Another really powerful method for visualization is called t-SNE (pronounced, tea-SNEE), which stands for t-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddings. Itâ€™s a non-linear dimensionality reduction that, again, aims to separate data in a way that clusters similar data close together and separates differing data.

As an example, below is a t-SNE reduction done on the MNIST dataset, which is a dataset of thousands of 28x28 images, similar to FashionMNIST, where each image is one of 10 hand-written digits 0-9.

The 28x28 pixel space of each digit is compressed to 2 dimensions by t-SNE and you can see that this produces ten clusters, one for each type of digits in the dataset!
