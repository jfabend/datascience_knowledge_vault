_bool_
A Boolean variable and can be set to either `True` or `False`. Cross-checking is very useful for eliminating false matches. Cross-checking works by performing the matching procedure two times. The first time the keypoints in the training image are compared to those in the query image; the second time, however, the keypoints in the query image are compared to those in the training image (_i.e._ the comparison is done backwards). When cross-checking is enabled a match is considered valid only if keypoint _A* in the training image is the best match of keypoint *B_ in the query image and vice-versa (that is, if keypoint _B* in the query image is the best match of point *A_ in the training image).
