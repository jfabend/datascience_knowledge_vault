Every contour has a number of features that you can calculate, including
- the area of the contour,
- it's [[Orientation]] (the direction that most of the contour is pointing in)
- it's perimeter
- [[Bounding Rectangle]]
- many other properties outlined in [OpenCV documentation, here](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_contours/py_contour_properties/py_contour_properties.html).
