_int_  
The number of random pixels used to produce each element of the oriented BRIEF descriptor. The possible values are 2, 3, and 4, with 2 being the default value. For example, a value of 3 means three random pixels are chosen at a time to compare their brightness. The index of the brightest pixel is returned. Since there are 3 pixels, the returned index will be either 0, 1, or 2.
