_int_  
This parameter can be set to either HARRIS_SCORE or FAST_SCORE. The default HARRIS_SCORE means that the Harris corner algorithm is used to rank features. The score is used to only retain the best features. The FAST_SCORE produces slightly less stable keypoints, but it is a little faster to compute.
