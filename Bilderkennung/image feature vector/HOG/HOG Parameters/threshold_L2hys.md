L2-Hys (Lowe-style clipped L2 norm) normalization method shrinkage. The L2-Hys method is used to normalize the blocks and it consists of an L2-norm followed by clipping and a renormalization. The clipping limits the maximum value of the descriptor vector for each block to have the value of the given threshold (0.2 by default). After the clipping the descriptor vector is renormalized as described in _IJCV_, 60(2):91-110, 2004.
