the [[Hist of Gradients (HOG)]] algorithm tries to detect edges locally. In order to do this, it defines groups of cells, called **blocks**, and normalizes the histograms using this local group of cells. By normalizing locally, the HOG algorithm can detect the edges in each block very reliably; this is called **block normalization**.
